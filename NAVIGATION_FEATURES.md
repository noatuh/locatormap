## Technical Details

### Routing Service
The application attempts to use routing services for accurate street-level navigation:
- Primary: OpenRouteService API (requires API key)
- Fallback: Straight-line routing when service is unavailable

### Transportation Modes
- **Walking** üö∂: Green route line, optimized for pedestrians
- **Driving** üöó: Red route line, follows roads suitable for cars
- **Cycling** üö¥: Orange route line, uses bike-friendly routes when available

### Features Added
1. Enhanced phone list with center and navigation buttons
2. Dedicated navigation panel with comprehensive controls
3. Transportation mode selection
4. Turn-by-turn directions display
5. POI integration with navigation
6. Visual route highlighting with different colors per transport mode
7. Automatic map fitting to show entire route
8. Origin phone selection and management

## Setup Notes
To enable full routing functionality:
1. Sign up for a free OpenRouteService API key at https://openrouteservice.org/
2. Replace `YOUR_ORS_API_KEY_HERE` in server.py with your actual API key
3. The application will fall back to straight-line routing if no API key is provided

The navigation system is designed to work with your existing phone tracking functionality, making it easy to navigate from any team member's location to any destination on the map.
